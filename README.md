## 🧠 SWI (Social Welfare Index) Formula

The Social Welfare Index (SWI) measures a student’s engagement and contribution in social activities.

\[
SWI = 100 \times (0.5 \times \frac{P_s}{P_t} + 0.25 \times \frac{V_s}{N_s} + 0.15 \times D + 0.1 \times \frac{N_s}{N_t})
\]

Where:
- \( P_s \): Points from social activities  
- \( P_t \): Total points  
- \( V_s \): Verified social activities  
- \( N_s \): Total social activities  
- \( N_t \): Total activities  
- \( D \): Diversity score (unique categories / total categories)
